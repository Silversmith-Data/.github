## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Silversmith Data is an industry leader in problem-solving, creating solution-based products that provide efficiency and ease for our partners. We have successfully developed innovative solutions for hundreds of clients with timely, cost-effective results

In 1992, David Silvers, an oil field technician, realized that manually gathering field data was inefficient, costly, and often incomplete. The solution? A patented communication system that effectively solved the information lag in the gas and oil industry.

For the next ten years, his company began to grow and expand into various industries. Eventually, he gained interest from entrepreneur and investor Jack Smith. The duo locked arms in 2003, and Silversmith Data was born.

A lot has changed since the two joined efforts, but the foundations upon which Silversmith Data was founded have stayed the same. Our companyâ€™s core is innovation, and we continuously deliver products that make our customerâ€™s jobs easier.

Between 2004 and 2013, we launched a series of products in the Oil and Gas Industries, setting national benchmarks and standards for remote monitoring.
